turtle.circle(100, 360, 14) #This is the coding on how to make a cicle.

"""The format to code a circle is turtle.circle(radius, extent, steps). The number
in the radius slot is the length of the radius. The extent is how much the cicle
is drawn in degrees. If the extent was 360 degrees, then it would draw the whole
circle. If it was 180 degrees, then it would only draw half. If the extent is not
given, then the program will draw the entire circle. If it is given, the arc
is drawn in a counterclockwise direction if the radius is positive. If not,
then the arc is drawn clockwise. The steps determines the number of sides the
polygon inscribed inside the circle will have. For example, 5 steps would mean
that the polygon inscribed inside the circle will have 5 sides. 6 steps would
translate into 6 sides. If the number of steps it given, then the program
will automatically calculate it.(Meaning that it will be a perfect circle
depending on how many pixels your device is capable of emitting."""

turtle.dot(15, "red")  #This will draw a cicular dot.
"""The base code for this is turtle.dot(size, "color"). Size indicates the
diameter of the dot, and color is a colorstring or a numeric color tuple. If
size is not given, then the maximum of pensize +4 and 2*pensize is used."""

"""This will stamp a copy of the turtle shape onto the canvas at the current
turtle position. Return a stamp_it for that stamp which can be deleted by using
clearstamp(stamp_it)."""
